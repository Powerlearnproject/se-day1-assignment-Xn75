Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the creation of software and ensuring that it runs smoothly by debugging. It is important because it can create software that make tasks easier.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The software crisis: Software needed a systematic approach to its development since it was becoming more complex
The rise of structured and OOP: It helped in the reusability and flexibility of code
The rise if the internet: It led to new areas like web applications that needed HTML and JavaScript

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: It defines the project,goals and objectives
Requirement analysis:It focuses on what the software needs to do
Design: It is where the software's achitecture and design are created
Implementation: It is where the actual code is written
Testing: It is done to identify and fix any bugs
Deployment: The software is released to users
Maintenance: It involves fixing bugs,providing updates and incorporating new features

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
They are both used for effective project management. Waterfall is used when projects have predictable requiremnet and a stable environment while Agile is used for projects that require flexibility, adaptability and continuous feedback.eg. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: To desing the software applications by writing the code
Quality assuarance Engineer: Ensure the quality of the software by identifying bugs and running tests on the software
Project manager: Oversees the software project to ensure the are within the budget and completed on time, as well as communicating with stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a comhrehensive set of tools in one interface so as to simplify the coding process. An example is VS code
VCS track changes to code, facilitates collaboration and allow all members to work on the same code. An example is GitHub

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge: Time management  
Solution: Software engineers should prioritize and breakdown complex tasks
Challenge: Burnout
Solution: We should have a healthy work life balance
Challenge: Technology updates 
Solution: We should continuously learn and experiment with new ideas to stay up to date

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: It tests every individual component to ensure its working correctly. It is important because identifies and fixes bugs early on in the development process  
Integration Testing: It tests the interaction of various components of the software. It is important because it ensures the interfaces of various components work as intended
System Testing: It tests the whole software. It is important because it ensures the software meets the functional and non functional requirements
Acceptance testing: It tests the whole software. It is important because it ensures the software is ready to be released to the customer

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is designing and refining prompts so as to get the desired input from AI models.
It is important because it enhances accuracy and improves efficiency of the AI models 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Write something about cars
Clear, specific, and concise prompt: Write a short paragraph on electric cars and why they are better than gasolin powered vehicles
The improved prompt is better since it is more specific and gives the AI a sense of direction so as to produce an answer that will benefit the user.
